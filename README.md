# Features
- Stylistic graphics and audio design
- 100 hand-designed levels, many of which creatively involve custom coding to manipulate physics or design elements
- Custom built UI with internal event handler. Implements buttons, pages, scrolling selection screens. Works across all screen resolutions
- Created custom tools to aid in development, including level designer that integrates fully with game for testing and deployment

# Technical Challenges
- Optimisation on lower end devices; Overcame by dynamically adjusting the physics simulation accuracy based on device performance. Increased simulation timestep and interpolated values to match target framerate
- Level design workflow; Built custom tool to design levels on my desktop environment and hosted on a local webserver. Built custom client application that loaded levels from local network to hot test on mobile device
- Used binary serialisation to export constructed levels from designer and package with final product
